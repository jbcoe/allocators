# Notes and a presentation about allocators for C++

We've worked for some time on new [value types for C++](https://github.com/jbcoe/value_types) and were invited to add allocator support by the C++ Standard Library Evolution Working Group.

We were advised that allocator support could not be added later, it needed to be part of the types from the beginning.

We set about learning about allocators and how to add them to our types. This repository is a collection of notes, examples and some talks about what we learned.

We spoke to many C++ experts on our journey. Wisdom is theirs, mistakes are our own.
